A demonstration of the use JaCoCo (http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) for capturing coverage data across multiple process. This example also demonstrates a server implementation which can append coverage data across multiple sessions.

Coverage can be seen in the reports by looking in build/reports and in particular at the coverage for the uk.co.codemonkey.example.Domain class.
